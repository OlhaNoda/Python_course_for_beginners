We have the following input list of numbers, some of them are prime.
You need to create a utility function that takes as input a number and returns a bool, whether it is prime or not.
Use ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor to create different concurrent implementations for filtering NUMBERS.
Compare the results and performance of each of them.
