They can cause bumblefoot (painful callouses on the pads of the foot) which is much more serious than long nails.  \n\nIt\u2019s easy to trim canary nails yourself.  You may need someone to help hold the bird or do the clipping. Catch your bird and hold it with a small cloth over it.   Hold the bird lying face up in your hand, don\u2019t hold too tightly but you don\u2019t want the bird to be able to squirm around either.  Using nail clippers that you use on yourself, clip just a small amount of nail.  If you can\u2019t see the \u2018quick\u2019 (where blood goes into the nail) take a flashlight and shine it below the nail so you know how much you can trim.
