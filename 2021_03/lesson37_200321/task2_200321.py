"""
As a solution to HW, create a file named: task2.sql with all SQL queries:
1. write a query to display the names (first_name, last_name) using alias name "First Name", "Last Name" from the table of employees;
2. write a query to get the unique department ID from the employee table
3. write a query to get all employee details from the employee table ordered by first name, descending
4. write a query to get the names (first_name, last_name), salary, PF of all the employees (PF is calculated as 12% of salary)
5. write a query to get the maximum and minimum salary from the employees table
6. write a query to get a monthly salary (round 2 decimal places) of each and every employee
