"""
Writing tests for context manager
Take your implementation of the context manager class from Task 1 and write tests for it.
Try to cover as many use cases as you can, positive ones when a file exists and everything works as designed.
And also, write tests when your class raises errors or you have errors in the runtime context suite.
